# Barred From Freedom
> You're just a little guy trying to fight his way out of the arenas after being captured by your sworn enemies. You must survive!


This is a video game that was made for my senior project. I wanted to make a rougelike game since that's one of my favorite genres and I was definitely inspired by the Risk of Rain series. Updates will come out for the game whenever I'm able to get to it.

## Download
Here's the download link if you would like to play the game. Hope you enjoy!
